<h2>
Call for Papers
</h2>

<p>
This is the eighth in a series of conferences that aims to bring together the leading researchers in
the areas of information theory, quantum information theory, and cryptography. ICITS covers all
aspects of information-theoretic security, from relevant mathematical tools to theoretical modeling
to implementation. Papers on all technical aspects of these topics are solicited for submission.
Areas of interest include, but are not restricted to:
</p>

<ul class="double">
<li>Physical layer security</li>
<li>Multiparty computations</li>
<li>Codes, lattices & cryptography</li>
<li>Authentication codes</li>
<li>Randomness extraction</li>
<li>Cryptography from noisy channels</li>
<li>Wiretap channels</li>
<li>Bounded-storage models</li>
<li>Information-theoretic reductions</li>
<li>Quantum cryptography</li>
<li>Quantum information theory</li>
<li>Nonlocality and nonsignaling</li>
<li>Key and message rates</li>

<h4>
Two Tracks: Conference and Workshop
</h4>

<p>
The goal of ICITS is to bring together researchers on all aspects of information-theoretic security.
To this end, ICITS&nbsp;2015 will consist of two types of contributed presentations. The conference track
will act as a traditional conference (original papers with published proceedings). The workshop
track will operate more like an informal workshop, with papers that have appeared elsewhere or
that consist of work in progress.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Conference Track (with proceedings)</b> Submissions to this track must be original papers that
have not previously appeared in published form. Accepted papers will be presented at the
conference and will also be published in the conference proceedings (which will appear in
Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series). We note that simultaneous submission
to journals is acceptable, but simultaneous submission to other conferences with published
proceedings is not.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Workshop Track (no proceedings)</b> To encourage presentation of work from a variety of fields
(especially those where conference publication is unusual or makes journal publication difficult),
the committee also solicits “workshop track” papers. Accepted papers will be presented
orally at the conference but will not appear in the proceedings. Submissions to this track
that have previously appeared (or are currently submitted elsewhere) are acceptable, as long
as they first appeared after January 1, 2011. Papers that describe work in progress are also
welcome. We note that the same standards of quality will apply to conference and workshop
papers.

<h4>
Instructions for Authors
</h4>

<p class="indent">
<b>Conference Track:</b> Submissions must not substantially duplicate work published elsewhere or
submitted in parallel to a journal or any other conference/workshop that has proceedings. The
submission must be <b>anonymous</b>, with no author names, affiliations, or obvious references. The
length of the submission must be at most 12 pages excluding bibliography and appendices. The text
must be in a single column format, use at least 11-point fonts, and have reasonable margins. The
submission should begin with a title and a short abstract. The introduction should summarize the
contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. Committee members
are not required to read appendices; the paper should be intelligible without them. Submissions
should preferably be in PDF format. Instructions on how to submit will be provided on the web
site.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Workshop track:</b> Authors may submit a paper published elsewhere or an original manuscript.
As with the conference track, submissions should begin with a title and short abstract followed
by an introduction that summarizes the contributions at a level appropriate for a non-specialist
reader. Information about previous publication, if any, should be indicated on the first page of
the submission. Beyond these guidelines no specific format is required. In particular, (a) papers
previously published elsewhere may be submitted in their published form provided bibliographic
information is clearly indicated; (b) short summaries of works available in other venues or online
(on the arxiv or IACR eprint) are acceptable; (c) original submissions may be left anonymous at
the discretion of the authors. (Previously published submissions cannot be anonymous.)
</p>

<p>There is no restriction on program committee member submissions to either track, though
PC-authored papers will be held to a higher standard.</p>
