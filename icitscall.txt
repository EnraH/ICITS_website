Call for Papers: ICITS 2015
===========================
8th International Conference on Information-theoretic Security (ICITS)
May 2-5, 2015, USI Lugano, Switzerland
www.icits2015.net


This is the eighth in a series of conferences that aims to bring together the leading researchers in the
areas of information theory, quantum information theory, and cryptography. ICITS covers all aspects of
information-theoretic security, from relevant mathematical tools to theoretical modeling to implementation.
Papers on all technical aspects of these topics are solicited for submission. Areas of interest include,
but are not restricted to:
Physical layer security / Multiparty computation / Codes, lattices, & cryptography / Authentication codes /
Randomness extraction / Cryptography from noisy channels / Wiretap channels / Bounded-storage models /
Information-theoretic reductions /  Quantum cryptography / Quantum information theory / Nonlocality and
nonsignaling / Key and message rates / Secret sharing / Physical models & assumptions / Network coding
security / Adversarial channel models / Information-theoretic tools in computational settings /
Implementation challenges / Biometric security





Important Dates:
- Conference Track Submission Deadline: November 21, 2014
- Workshop Track Submission Deadline: December 5, 2014
- Notification of Decision: January 30, 2015
- Conference: May 2-5, 2015





Two Tracks: Conference and Workshop:
As the goal of ICITS is to bring together researchers on all aspects of information-theoretic security,
it consists of two tracks with different types of contributed presentations:

- Conference Track (with proceedings): Submissions to this track must be original papers that have not
previously appeared in published form. Accepted papers will be presented at the conference and will
appear in the conference proceedings, which will be published by Springer in the LNCS series.

- Workshop Track (no proceedings): To encourage presentation of work from a variety of fields (especially
those where conference publication is unusual or makes journal publication difficult), the committee also
solicits "workshop track" papers. Accepted papers will be presented orally at the conference but will not
appear in the proceedings. Submissions to this track that have previously appeared (or are currently
submitted elsewhere) are acceptable, as long as they first appeared after January 1, 2014. Papers that
describe work in progress are also welcome. We note that the same standards of quality will apply to
conference and workshop papers.





Instruction for Authors:
- Conference Track: Submissions must not substantially duplicate work published elsewhere or submitted in
parallel to a journal or any other conference/workshop that has proceedings. The submission must be
anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, or obvious references. The length of the submission must be
at most 12 pages excluding bibliography and appendices. The text must be in a single column format, use at
least 11- point fonts, and have reasonable margins. The submission should begin with a title and a short
abstract. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a
non-specialist reader. Committee members are not required to read appendices; the paper should be
intelligible without them. Submissions should preferably be in PDF format. Instructions on how to submit
will be provided on the web site.

- Workshop Track: Authors may submit a paper published elsewhere or an original manuscript. As with the
conference track, submissions should begin with a title and short abstract followed by an introduction that
summarizes the contributions at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. Information about 
previous publication, if any, should be indicated on the first page of the submission. Beyond these
guidelines no specific format is required. In particular, (a) papers previously published elsewhere may be
submitted in their published form provided bibliographic information is clearly indicated; (b) short
summaries of works available in other venues or online (on the arXiv or IACR eprint) are acceptable;
(c) original submissions may be left anonymous at the discretion of the authors. (Previously published
submissions cannot be anonymous.)


There is no restriction on program committee member submissions to either track, though PC-authored papers
will be held to a higher standard.
