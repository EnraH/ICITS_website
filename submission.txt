Instructions for Authors
</h4>

<p class="indent">
<b>Conference Track:</b> Submissions must not substantially duplicate work published elsewhere or
submitted in parallel to a journal or any other conference/workshop that has proceedings. The
submission must be <b>anonymous</b>, with no author names, affiliations, or obvious references. The
length of the submission must be at most 12 pages excluding bibliography and appendices. The text
must be in a single column format, use at least 11-point fonts, and have reasonable margins. The
submission should begin with a title and a short abstract. The introduction should summarize the
contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. Committee members
are not required to read appendices; the paper should be intelligible without them. Submissions
should preferably be in PDF format.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<b>Workshop track:</b> Authors may submit a paper published elsewhere or an original manuscript.
As with the conference track, submissions should begin with a title and short abstract followed
by an introduction that summarizes the contributions at a level appropriate for a non-specialist
reader. Information about previous publication, if any, should be indicated on the first page of
the submission. Beyond these guidelines no specific format is required. In particular, (a) papers
previously published elsewhere may be submitted in their published form provided bibliographic
information is clearly indicated; (b) short summaries of works available in other venues or online
(on the arxiv or IACR eprint) are acceptable; (c) original submissions may be left anonymous at
the discretion of the authors. (Previously published submissions cannot be anonymous.)
</p>

<p>Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their paper(s) at the conference.</p>


<p>There is no restriction on program committee member submissions to either track, though
PC-authored papers will be held to a higher standard.</p>
